description: |
  Large static assets should be optimized for online display or ideally be housed in other services, e.g.
  Amazon S3 (for files) or Youtube (for videos). Storing large files can consume storage volumes,
  increase page load time and contribute to a higher than desired cache eviction rate. Varnish, on Acquia Cloud,
  does not cache files larger than 10 MB.

  This extends on the LargeDrupalFiles policy/audit provided by Drutiny and adds an extension check when the
  extensions parameter is provided.

  This policy identifies files managed by Drupal that are larger than {{readable_max_size}}.
remediation: |
  Either delete the large Drupal files found that exceed {{readable_max_size}} if they are not needed, compress or optimize them,
  or look to house them in a more appropriate location.
success: No large files found with matching extensions.
warning: |
  Files with configured extensions were found over {{readable_max_size}}.

  Work towards reducing the size of all {{total}} files to remediate this warning.
  The results otherwise poses no risk other than site performance and/or cachability.

  The table below contains the following data:
      - **URI** - The path and filename.
      - **Size** - The size of the file as reported by Drupal.
      - **Used** - Determines if the file is associated with any content according to Drupal's file_usage table.

  URI | Size | Used
    --- | --- | ---
    {{# files }}
      {{uri}} | {{size}} | {{usage}}
    {{/ files }}
    {{too_many_files}}
parameters:
  max_size:
    default: 2000000
